-- This Is Mafiosia's Intro
-- Please add this sound ID until we can get it redone by an sfx person
-- "100484735830453"
-- also please make the text have 3 dots appear at a time constantly and have the intro screen fade out eventually
-- "." ".." "..." "." repeat until fade out

-- real proposition:
--make it so setting killer firesallcients to set local camera cframe to specific part, have gui elements spawn in and after set camera cframe back to local character
--pros: is easy
--cons: another remote event
