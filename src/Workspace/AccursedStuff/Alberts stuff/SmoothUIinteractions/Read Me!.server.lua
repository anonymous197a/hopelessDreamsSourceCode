    What do i need to do for it to work?

    - First, you have to identify the TextButtons and Image buttons in your game, and then, in the *Properties* tab, locate the *Tags* property, and then, click the + icon, and insert this into the the textbar: `Button`.

	- Second, you **NEED** to have your guis to be sized on the **SCALE** property **AND NOT OFFSET** property!

	- Third, set the *AnchorPoint* to `(0.5, 0.5)`

	- Fourth and last, place the *SmoothGUIInteraction* in *StarterPlayerScripts*, which can be found in *StarterPlayer*.
	
	- You can delete the ExampleGui, its just an example, as the name suggests.
	
	- Also, for customization, you can change the properties in SmoothGUIInteraction>Settings to be the way you like!
